Astro processes, optimizes, and bundles your src/ files to create the final website that is shipped to the browser. Unlike the static public/ directory, your src/ files are built and handled for you by Astro.


While this guide describes some popular conventions used in the Astro community, the only directories reserved by Astro are src/pages/ and src/content/. You are free to rename and reorganize any other directories in a way that works best for you.


Components are reusable units of code for your HTML pages. These could be Astro components, or UI framework components like React or Vue. It is common to group and organize all of your project components together in this folder.

This is a common convention in Astro projects, but it is not required. Feel free to organize your components however you like!

Layouts are Astro components that define the UI structure shared by one or more pages.

Just like src/components, this directory is a common convention but not required.

Pages are a special kind of component used to create new pages on your site. A page can be an Astro component, or a Markdown file that represents some page of content for your site.

Why astro
    Astro is the web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs, marketing, and e-commerce. Astro is best-known for pioneering a new frontend architecture to reduce JavaScript overhead and complexity compared to other frameworks. ***If you need a website that loads fast and has great SEO, then Astro is for you.***



Some highlights include:

Islands: A component-based web architecture optimized for content-driven websites.
UI-agnostic: Supports React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit, HTMX, web components, and more.
Server-first: Moves expensive rendering off of your visitors’ devices.
Zero JS, by default: Less client-side JavaScript to slow your site down.
Content collections: Organize, validate, and provide TypeScript type-safety for your Markdown content.
Customizable: Tailwind, MDX, and hundreds of integrations to choose from.

Content-driven
Astro was designed for building content-rich websites. This includes marketing sites, publishing sites, documentation sites, blogs, portfolios, landing pages, community sites, and e-commerce sites. If you have content to show, it needs to reach your reader quickly.

By contrast, most modern web frameworks were designed for building web applications. These frameworks excel at building more complex, application-like experiences in the browser: logged-in admin dashboards, inboxes, social networks, todo lists, and even native-like applications like Figma and Ping. However with that complexity, they can struggle to provide great performance when delivering your content.

Astro’s focus on content from its beginnings as a static site builder have allowed Astro to sensibly scale up to performant, powerful, dynamic web applications that still respect your content and your audience. Astro’s unique focus on content lets Astro make tradeoffs and deliver unmatched performance features that wouldn’t make sense for more application-focused web frameworks to implement.

Astro leverages server-rendering over client-side rendering in the browser as much as possible. This is the same approach that traditional server-side frameworks -- PHP, WordPress, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, etc. -- have been using for decades. But you don’t need to learn a second server-side language to unlock it. With Astro, everything is still just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or TypeScript, if you prefer).

This approach stands in contrast to other modern JavaScript web frameworks like Next.js, SvelteKit, Nuxt, Remix, and others. These frameworks were built for client-side rendering of your entire website and include server-side rendering mainly to address performance concerns. This approach has been dubbed the Single-Page App (SPA), in contrast with Astro’s Multi-Page App (MPA) approach.

The SPA model has its benefits. However, these come at the expense of additional complexity and performance tradeoffs. These tradeoffs harm page performance -- critical metrics like Time to Interactive (TTI) -- which doesn’t make much sense for content-focused websites where first-load performance is essential.

Astro’s server-first approach allows you to opt in to client-side rendering only if, and exactly as, necessary. You can choose to add UI framework components that run on the client. You can take advantage of Astro’s view transitions router for finer control over select page transitions and animations. Astro’s server-first rendering, either pre-rendered or on-demand, provides performant defaults that you can enhance and extend.

In Astro, an “island” refers to any interactive UI component on the page. Think of an island as an interactive widget floating in a sea of otherwise static, lightweight, server-rendered HTML.

An island always runs in isolation from other islands on the page, and multiple islands can exist on a page. Islands can still share state and communicate with each other, even though they run in different component contexts.
