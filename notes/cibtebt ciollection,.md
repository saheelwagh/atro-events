Content collections are the best way to manage and author content in any Astro project. Collections help to organize your documents, validate your frontmatter, and provide automatic TypeScript type-safety for all of your content.


What are Content Collections?
A content collection is any top-level directory inside the reserved src/content project directory, such as src/content/newsletter and src/content/authors. Only content collections are allowed inside the src/content directory. This directory cannot be used for anything else.
